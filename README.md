TODO: A model of quadcopter was designed in gazebo and controlled using ROS and PID control algorithm
## Concept behind the working
TODO:Once the gazebo model is built, PID control algorithm is being used in real time to produce the control action.The set points to the quadcopter in 3D environments are stored in an array, and based on the set point and current position of the quadcopter, the error in x,y,z direction is calculated and a parallel PID is implemented.
